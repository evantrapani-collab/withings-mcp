# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## General Rules

Always execute tasks in parallel when possible. If multiple independent operations need to be performed (e.g., reading files, running searches, editing unrelated files, running builds), do them simultaneously rather than sequentially. Only run tasks sequentially when there is a dependency between them.

## Project Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates Withings health data with Claude. It implements OAuth 2.0 authentication with PKCE support and uses the Streamable HTTP transport (via the SDK's `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport`) for communication between MCP clients and the server.

## Development Commands

### Running
```bash
bun run start        # Run the server (Bun executes TypeScript directly)
bun run dev          # Hot-reload mode for local development
bun run typecheck    # Type-check with tsc (no emit)
bun run build        # Bundle for production (outputs to ./build)
```

### Deployment
Deployed to DigitalOcean App Platform, which detects Bun automatically via its buildpack and runs `bun run start`.

### Logging

The server uses a **custom logger** optimized for Deno Deploy with strict privacy controls suitable for public repositories:

**Privacy-Safe Configuration** (src/utils/logger.ts):
- **NO** tokens, access codes, or authentication credentials
- **NO** user IDs, email addresses, or personal information
- **NO** API request/response payloads containing sensitive data
- **ONLY** operational events, errors, and minimal diagnostic information

**Log Levels:**
- `error`: Critical failures requiring attention
- `warn`: Non-critical issues or deprecations
- `info`: Important operational events (connections, disconnections)
- `debug`: Detailed diagnostic information (disabled in production)
- `trace`: Very detailed diagnostic information

**Log Format:**
Logs are output in a readable plain-text format: `LEVEL [component] message {optional data}`

Example: `INFO [oauth] Starting OAuth authorization flow`

**Redacted Fields:**
All sensitive fields are automatically redacted including: `token`, `access_token`, `code`, `client_secret`, `code_verifier`, `userid`, `email`, `password`, `sessionId`, `state`, and more.

**Environment Variables:**
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set log level (default: `info`) - supports trace, debug, info, warn, error

**Component Loggers:**
Each module creates a child logger with context:
- `component: "oauth"` - Authentication flow events
- `component: "middleware"` - Request authentication
- `component: "mcp-endpoints"` - MCP session lifecycle
- `component: "tools:measure"` - Measure tool invocations
- `component: "tools:sleep"` - Sleep tool invocations
- `component: "tools:user"` - User tool invocations
- `component: "tools:heart"` - Heart tool invocations
- `component: "tools:stetho"` - Stetho tool invocations
- `component: "supabase"` - Database client initialization

### Date and Timestamp Handling

The server provides bidirectional date/timestamp conversion utilities (src/utils/timestamp.ts):

#### Input: YYYY-MM-DD → Unix Timestamp

MCP tools accept dates in human-readable YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2025-11-17") which are automatically converted to Unix timestamps before calling the Withings API.

**Function:** `dateToUnixTimestamp(dateString: string): number`
- Accepts: YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2025-11-17")
- Returns: Unix timestamp in seconds since epoch (midnight UTC)
- Validates: Format, month (1-12), day (1-31), and date validity
- Throws: Clear errors for invalid dates

**Used by:** Tools that accept date parameters (`get_sleep`, `get_measures`, `get_intraday_activity`, `list_heart_records`, `list_stetho_records`)

#### Output: Unix Timestamp → Timezone-Aware Datetime

The server automatically converts Unix timestamps in API responses to human-readable datetime strings using timezone information from the Withings API.

**Conversion Behavior:**
- **With timezone field**: Timestamps are converted to localized datetime in the format `"2024-01-15 12:30:00 Europe/Paris"`
- **Without timezone field**: Timestamps fall back to UTC ISO 8601 format `"2024-01-15T11:30:00.000Z"`
- Original Unix timestamp values are **replaced** with readable datetime strings in tool responses

**Timestamp Fields Converted:**
`startdate`, `enddate`, `date`, `created`, `modified`, `timestamp`, `first_session_date`, `last_session_date`, `birthdate`, `lastupdate`

**Special Handling:**
- **night_events** in sleep data: Array of timestamps converted to localized datetime strings
- **Nested objects**: Recursively processes all nested timestamp fields

**Example Transformation:**
```javascript
// Input (from Withings API)
{
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
  "startdate": 1705318200,
  "enddate": 1705347000
}

// Output (returned to MCP client)
{
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
  "startdate": "2024-01-15 12:30:00 Europe/Paris",
  "enddate": "2024-01-15 20:30:00 Europe/Paris"
}
```

**Implementation Functions:**
- `dateToUnixTimestamp()`: Converts YYYY-MM-DD to Unix timestamp
- `formatTimestamp()`: Converts to UTC ISO 8601
- `formatTimestampWithTimezone()`: Converts to localized datetime using Intl.DateTimeFormat
- `addReadableTimestamps()`: Recursively processes objects and replaces timestamp fields
- `addReadableNightEvents()`: Special handler for sleep data night_events arrays

### OAuth 2.0 Flow Architecture

The server implements a **double OAuth flow** to bridge MCP clients with Withings:

1. **MCP Client ↔ This Server**: Standard OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (MCP specification)
2. **This Server ↔ Withings API**: Withings-specific OAuth 2.0

**Flow sequence**:
- MCP client discovers server via `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- Client initiates OAuth at `/authorize` → server validates `client_id` against registered clients and `redirect_uri` against the client's registered URIs, then redirects to Withings
- Withings redirects back to `/callback` → server generates auth code
- Client exchanges code at `/token` → auth code is atomically consumed (single-use per RFC 6749), server exchanges Withings code and returns MCP access token
- MCP access tokens map to Withings tokens in storage

**OAuth Security**:
- **Redirect URI validation**: `/authorize` requires a registered `client_id` and validates `redirect_uri` against the client's registered URIs to prevent open redirect attacks
- **Single-use auth codes**: Auth codes are atomically consumed via `DELETE ... RETURNING` to prevent replay attacks
- **Auth code encryption**: Withings authorization codes are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM before storage in `auth_codes` table
- **Startup validation**: Server fails fast if required environment variables (`WITHINGS_CLIENT_ID`, `WITHINGS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `WITHINGS_REDIRECT_URI`) are missing

**Token Lifetimes**:
- **MCP Access Token**: Valid for 30 days (returned to Claude Desktop with `expires_in: 2592000`)
- **Withings Access Token**: Valid for ~3 hours (automatically refreshed transparently by the server)
- **Withings Refresh Token**: Used to obtain new Withings access tokens when they expire
- The MCP client (Claude Desktop) only needs to re-authenticate every 30 days, while Withings tokens are refreshed automatically in the background during API calls

### MCP Transport Layer

The server uses the SDK's **`WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport`** (Streamable HTTP) for MCP communication:

- **Endpoint**: `/mcp` handles all HTTP methods via a single `handleMcp` handler (src/server/mcp-endpoints.ts)
- **POST /mcp** (no session): Initializes a new session — creates a `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` and per-session `McpServer`, returns SSE stream with `Mcp-Session-Id` header
- **POST /mcp** (with session): Forwards JSON-RPC messages to the session's transport
- **GET /mcp**: Establishes SSE stream for server-to-client messages on an existing session
- **DELETE /mcp**: Terminates the session and cleans up resources
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (MCP access token) required in `Authorization` header
- **Routing**: `app.all(MCP_ENDPOINT, authenticateBearer, handleMcp)` in src/server/app.ts

**Session Management** (src/server/mcp-endpoints.ts):
- Live sessions are held in an in-memory `Map<string, { transport, mcpToken, ... }>` keyed by session ID, and the `sessionId → mcpToken` binding is mirrored to the `mcp_sessions` table so sessions **survive restarts** (see Session Rehydration below)
- Session IDs generated by the SDK via `sessionIdGenerator: () => crypto.randomUUID()`
- Sessions are bound to the bearer token that created them, but **`mcp_sessions` — not the in-memory Map — is the authority** on that binding. The Map is a cache, trusted only while it agrees with the presented bearer; a request whose bearer disagrees re-reads the stored row before deciding. If the row names the presented token (an OAuth token rotation, possibly served by another replica) the session is **rebuilt** under it; otherwise the request is answered `404 {"error": "invalid_session"}` — byte-identical to the response an unknown session ID gets
- A rotated bearer heals by rebuilding, never by re-labelling the cached entry: `createServer()` passes the token to `registerAllTools()` by value, so a session whose `mcpToken` field were merely reassigned would pass the ownership gate and then fail every tool call with "Invalid or expired token" (src/withings/api.ts)
- A superseded transport is **unbound immediately but closed only after a drain** (`SUPERSEDED_DRAIN_MS`, 60s). The SDK's `close()` synchronously runs `cleanup()` over every open stream, so closing on the request path aborts requests that were authenticated while the old bearer was still live and have not yet written a response — on an SSE stream that is a 200 with an empty body and a client that waits forever. The drain timer is also what reclaims the transport, since the idle sweep only walks `sessions`
- Map entries are deleted identity-guarded (`forgetSession()`). A transport's `onclose` calls back into the Map, and a superseded transport is closed long after its replacement was registered under the same session ID, so an unguarded delete would evict the replacement
- `resolveSession()` re-reads the Map **after** its store round-trip rather than trusting the pre-await snapshot. Two requests for one cold session (the client reconnects its GET stream and POSTs at the same moment) would otherwise each build a transport, orphaning one of them
- `onsessioninitialized` callback registers the session in the Map and persists it
- `onsessionclosed` callback (triggered by DELETE) removes the session from both the Map and Supabase
- `transport.onclose` (idle sweep, shutdown, internal SDK errors) drops the in-memory entry **only** — the stored row survives, so idle eviction is a memory optimisation rather than a session kill
- SSE streaming, JSON-RPC validation, and protocol handling are all managed by the SDK transport internally
- Request body size is limited to 1MB globally via Hono `bodyLimit()` middleware
- **No `/mcp` path returns 403.** The status ladder is 401 (`authenticateBearer` — the only genuine authentication failure, and the only one carrying `WWW-Authenticate`), 400 (non-POST with no usable session), 404 (any session ID this bearer cannot use), 500 (internal rebuild failure)

**Session Rehydration** (src/server/mcp-endpoints.ts, src/auth/session-store.ts):

A session ID the process has no memory of — after a restart, an idle eviction, or because another instance handled the handshake — is rebuilt from `mcp_sessions` instead of returning 404. This matters because recovery from a 404 is slow and unreliable, not because it is impossible. The TypeScript SDK client throws without ever clearing its session ID ([typescript-sdk#1708](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/issues/1708)), so a client built on it wedges until the whole app is restarted; the Claude connector does recover, but only through its own retry logic and only after a burst of failures (production, 2026-09-09: rejections at 09:22:15 and 09:22:19, re-initialization at 09:22:21). Rehydration exists to avoid paying that wherever the request *can* be served. Where it cannot — the stored row names a different owner, so there is nothing this bearer is entitled to rebuild — 404 remains the right answer, and is strictly better than the 403 it replaced: 403 asserts that re-authenticating will not help, when re-initializing is exactly what helps, and it was an existence oracle distinguishing a live session ID from a fabricated one.

How it works:
- The rehydrated transport is constructed **without** `sessionIdGenerator`, putting it in stateless mode so `validateSession()` returns early instead of rejecting the request with `400 "Bad Request: Server not initialized"` — the handshake that would have set that flag happened in a process that no longer exists
- `transport.sessionId` is then assigned directly (a public field on the SDK's `Transport` interface), so responses keep echoing the client's existing `Mcp-Session-Id` and the client never learns anything changed
- Ownership is enforced in `handleMcp` before rehydrating, since a stateless transport performs no session validation of its own
- Concurrent requests for the same cold session share one in-flight rehydration (`rehydrating` Map) rather than racing. The Map is keyed by session ID **and owner**: a rehydration started under a bearer that has since been rotated away builds tools closed over the dead token value, so it must not be joined across a rotation
- The same rebuild serves a **bearer-token rotation**. `resolveSession()` re-reads `mcp_sessions` whenever the cached owner disagrees with the presented bearer and rebuilds under the stored owner — the stored row is verified *before* anything is torn down, so a refused request mutates nothing and cannot be used to kill a stranger's transport
- Nothing else needs restoring: tool handlers close over the MCP token alone and re-read all Withings credentials from Supabase per call
- `initialize` requests never rehydrate — a stale session ID sent with a handshake is ignored and a fresh session is created

Limits: in-flight SSE streams and unsent responses die with the process (the socket is gone), and `Last-Event-ID` replay does not cross a restart — per spec that is a live-server mechanism, and no `EventStore` is configured. Negotiated client capabilities are also lost, which is harmless here since all tools are read-only and the server never initiates sampling, elicitation, or roots.

This is also what makes running **multiple replicas** viable: every other piece of state was already Postgres-backed, so the in-memory session Map was the sole obstacle.

### Data Storage

Uses **Supabase PostgreSQL** (@supabase/supabase-js) for persistent storage:

**Database Schema** (supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql):
- `mcp_tokens`: MCP token → Withings token mapping (30 day TTL)
- `oauth_sessions`: OAuth session state (10 min TTL)
- `auth_codes`: Authorization codes (10 min TTL)
- `registered_clients`: Dynamic client registration (no TTL)
- `rate_limits`: Rate limiting counters (dynamic window TTL)
- `mcp_sessions`: MCP session ID → owning MCP token (30 day TTL, supabase/migrations/006_mcp_sessions.sql)
- `check_rate_limit()`: Atomic PostgreSQL function for race-condition-free rate limiting (uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`)

**Token Refresh — deliberately not a rotation** (src/auth/token-store.ts, src/auth/oauth.ts):

This server issues **one opaque value as both `access_token` and `refresh_token`**. Given that, the `refresh_token` grant **must not rotate**: it calls `extendToken()`, which renews the row's 30-day `expires_at` and returns the same token.

Rotation was the cause of a production incident (2026-09-09). Because the refresh token *is* the bearer, minting a new value invalidated the token every other concurrent holder was still using. Whichever holder missed the 60s single-slot grace was left with a value that was simultaneously a dead bearer and a dead refresh token — no credential left to recover with — and looped `401 /mcp` → `refresh` → `400 invalid_grant` at ~2/sec: 78 failed refreshes in 16 seconds, then 10× 429, after which the user had to redo the entire Withings authorization.

- `extendToken()` renews the TTL only. It never writes `mcp_token`, so there is nothing to cascade to `mcp_sessions`. It returns `false` when no **live** row matched (`expires_at > now()`), so the caller answers `invalid_grant` instead of reporting success for a token it did not extend.
- Refresh is now idempotent by construction: a retried or concurrent refresh extends the same row and returns the same value, so a lost response can no longer strand a client.
- `resolveRefreshToken()` still maps a presented value to the currently-live one: first by `mcp_token`, then by `previous_mcp_token` inside the 60s grace. That path now exists to recover clients holding a token rotated away **before** this change; it is not fed by any new rotation.
- Grace applies **only** to the `/token` refresh path. `authenticateBearer` accepts the live token only, so a superseded token cannot be used against `/mcp`.
- `rotateToken()` is retained but **deliberately unwired**. Nothing is lost by not rotating: the refresh token is sent as the bearer on every `/mcp` request, so an attacker holding one already holds the other and there is no replay for rotation to detect. Issuing **distinct** access and refresh tokens is the precondition for wiring it back — do not reintroduce rotation without that.

**Rate limiting is scoped per grant type** on `/token` (`rateLimit({ scope })`, identifier `${ip}:${path}:${grant_type}`). A client looping on a dead `refresh_token` used to exhaust the shared budget and then get 429ed on `authorization_code` — the only exchange that could repair it — locking the user out for the rest of the window. This remains the backstop for a genuinely expired (30-day) grant, which is still terminal; what changed is that refresh no longer *creates* dead tokens. Hono caches the parsed form body, so the scope resolver reading it does not prevent the handler from parsing it again.

### Rate Limiting Algorithm

`check_rate_limit()` is a **weighted two-window sliding counter** (supabase/migrations/008_sliding_window_rate_limit.sql), not a fixed window. Each identifier keeps a current and a previous count, and the trailing rate is estimated as:

```
estimate = previous_count * (time_left_in_current_window / window) + current_count
```

Capacity therefore returns *continuously* as the previous window ages out, instead of snapping back at a boundary. The fixed window it replaced meant a client that burned its budget in the first seconds stayed locked out for the whole remainder — up to ~59 minutes on `/token`.

The function **clamps a `reset_time` that sits further out than one window** (migration 009). Without that, a row written under a longer window keeps its distant boundary forever, the weight pins at 1.0, the window never rolls and capacity never decays — which reintroduces exactly the long lockout this design exists to prevent. The clamp makes window length safe to reconfigure.

**The window length must stay short.** Smoothing lengthens the worst-case tail: a fully-burned window takes up to **two** window lengths to decay completely, versus one for a fixed window. Sliding windows are only an improvement when the window is small, which is why all three callers use 5 minutes. Do not raise them back to an hour.

Current limits (all 5-minute sliding windows, keyed per IP + path, plus grant type on `/token`):
- `/token`: 30 — a legitimate client needs 1–3 calls per authorization
- `/authorize`: 15
- `/register`: 5

Measured recovery for `/token` after burning all 30 instantly: fully blocked for 5 minutes, then linear recovery (28 available at +5m30s, 17 at +7m30s, 4 at +9m59s), fully clear by 10 minutes. On the denied path the function returns the moment capacity actually becomes available, so `Retry-After` is honest rather than pointing at a raw window boundary.

**Token Store** (src/auth/token-store.ts):
- Maps MCP tokens → Withings tokens (access, refresh, userId, expiry)
- **Security**: Withings tokens encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM (src/utils/encryption.ts)
- Encryption key derived from `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` via PBKDF2
- **TTL**: 30 days - enforced via `expires_at` column + query filtering
- **Token Refresh**: Withings access tokens (~3 hour lifetime) are automatically refreshed when expired/expiring during API calls (src/withings/api.ts)

**Session Store** (src/auth/session-store.ts):
- Maps MCP session IDs → the bearer token that owns them (`mcp_sessions` table)
- **TTL**: 30 days, matching `mcp_tokens` — a session can never outlive its bearer token
- `expires_at` is refreshed on a 5-minute throttle rather than per request, so an active session stays alive without adding a write to every tool call
- `rotateToken()` is called by `tokenStore.rotateToken()` on the OAuth `refresh_token` grant, so sessions opened under the old bearer stay owned by the same client instead of being rejected as belonging to someone else. The cascade is best-effort (`tokenStore.rotateToken()` swallows its failure so the already-committed `/token` response is not 500ed). When it fails the stored row keeps the old token, the self-heal correctly declines, and the client recovers via 404 → re-initialize instead of the 30-minute wedge a 403 used to cause

**OAuth Store** (src/auth/oauth.ts):
- OAuth sessions (10min TTL): `oauth_sessions` table
- Auth codes (10min TTL): `auth_codes` table (Withings code encrypted at rest)
- Auth codes are consumed atomically via `consumeAuthCode()` (DELETE + SELECT in one query) to prevent replay
- Registered clients (no TTL): `registered_clients` table

**TTL Implementation**:
- All queries filter by `expires_at > now()` to exclude expired records
- Expired records are purged by `pg_cron` jobs scheduled in Supabase (supabase/migrations/005_pg_cron_cleanup.sql):
  - Every 5 minutes: oauth_sessions, auth_codes, rate_limits
  - Hourly: mcp_tokens; mcp_sessions (supabase/migrations/006_mcp_sessions.sql)
  - Daily: tool_analytics
- Running cleanup in the database (rather than via in-process `setInterval` on Deno Deploy) lets idle isolates be recycled, reducing Memory Time usage.

## Environment Variables

Required:
- `WITHINGS_CLIENT_ID`: From Withings developer console
- `WITHINGS_CLIENT_SECRET`: From Withings developer console
- `WITHINGS_REDIRECT_URI`: Callback URL (must match Withings app settings)
- `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`: Secret key for encrypting tokens at rest (min 32 chars, generate with `npm run generate-secret` or `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL (from Dashboard → Settings → API)
- `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`: Supabase service role key (from Dashboard → Settings → API)

Optional:
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level - trace, debug, info, warn, error (default: info)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins for browser-based clients

See `.env.example` for template.

## MCP Tools

The server implements 13 MCP tools for accessing Withings health data, organized by Withings API category. All tools are registered via `registerAllTools()` (src/tools/index.ts) on per-session `McpServer` instances to ensure proper session isolation.

**Date Parameters:** All tools that accept date parameters use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2025-11-17"). The server automatically converts these to Unix timestamps before calling the Withings API.

### Sleep Tools (src/tools/sleep.ts)

#### get_sleep

Retrieves high-frequency sleep data captured during sleep, including sleep stages and health metrics at minute-level resolution.

**Parameters:**
- `startdate`: Start date (YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g., '2025-11-17')
- `enddate`: End date (YYYY-MM-DD format, max 24h range from startdate)
- `data_fields`: Optional comma-separated list of specific fields

**Note:** If startdate and enddate are separated by more than 24h, only the first 24h after startdate will be returned.

#### get_sleep_summary

Retrieves sleep summary data including:
- Sleep duration and stages (light, deep, REM)
- Heart rate metrics during sleep
- Breathing quality
- Sleep score

**Parameters:**
- `startdateymd`: Start date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `enddateymd`: End date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `lastupdate`: Unix timestamp for sync (alternative to date range)
- `data_fields`: Optional comma-separated list of specific fields

#### get_hrv

Retrieves heart rate variability captured during sleep at minute-level resolution. A thin wrapper over the same `/v2/sleep` `get` action as `get_sleep`, with `data_fields` hardcoded to `rmssd,sdnn_1,hrv_quality` — it exists for discoverability, since clients rarely guess the Withings field names on their own.

**Parameters:**
- `startdate`: Start date (YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g., '2025-11-17')
- `enddate`: End date (YYYY-MM-DD format, max 24h range from startdate)

**Response shape:** Each `series` entry carries `rmssd`, `sdnn_1`, and `hrv_quality` as **timestamp-keyed maps** (`Record<string, number>`), the same shape as `hr`/`rr`/`snoring` — not scalars. RMSSD and SDNN are in milliseconds; `hrv_quality` is a per-sample confidence score. `addReadableTimestamps()` converts the entry-level `startdate`/`enddate`, but the sample map **keys stay as raw Unix seconds** because the transform walks values, not keys.

**Note:** Dates convert to midnight UTC, so the window is a UTC calendar day rather than a sleep period — a single night can straddle two requests for non-UTC users, and one request can return the tail of one night plus the onset of the next.

### Measure Tools (src/tools/measure.ts)

#### get_measures

Retrieves health measures with automatic type descriptions and calculated values:
- Weight, height, body composition (fat mass, muscle mass, bone mass)
- Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)
- Heart rate and pulse wave velocity
- Temperature (body, skin)
- Advanced metrics (VO2 max, vascular age, metabolic age, BMR)
- ECG intervals, atrial fibrillation detection
- Body composition details (hydration, visceral fat, extracellular/intracellular water)

### Adding New Tools

To add new Withings API tools:

1. Create a new file in `src/tools/` based on the Withings API category
2. Export a `register[Category]Tools()` function that takes `(server, mcpAccessToken)`
3. Import and call your registration function in `src/tools/index.ts`
4. Add corresponding API client functions to `src/withings/api.ts`
5. Add response type interfaces to `src/types/withings.ts`
6. Add a component logger entry (e.g., `component: "tools:newcategory"`)

Implemented tool categories:
- Sleep API (high-frequency sleep data, sleep summary data)
- Measure API (health measures, workouts, activities)
- User API (devices, goals)
- Heart API (ECG recordings and signals)
- Stetho API (stethoscope recordings and signals)

Additional tool categories available in Withings API:
- Notify API (webhooks/notifications)
- Survey API (health surveys)

## Important Implementation Details

### PKCE Support

The OAuth implementation supports PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security. The code verifier is validated in src/auth/oauth.ts using SHA-256 hashing.

### Session Isolation

Each initialization request creates a **separate McpServer instance** and its own `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` (src/server/mcp-endpoints.ts). This ensures tools and state are isolated per session. Tools are registered per-session via `registerAllTools()` from src/tools/index.ts. Sessions are bound to the bearer token used at creation, preventing cross-user session access.

### HTTP Security

- **HTTPS redirect**: Production requests via `x-forwarded-proto: http` are redirected to HTTPS (localhost excluded)
- **Body size limit**: 1MB global limit via Hono `bodyLimit()` middleware
- **CORS**: No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header for requests without an Origin header; only localhost and configured origins are allowed
- **CSP**: External stylesheets with `style-src 'self'` (no `unsafe-inline`)
- **Security headers**: HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy

### Transport Lifecycle

- On initialization POST: transport + McpServer created, `server.connect(transport)` called, then `transport.handleRequest()` processes the request
- On subsequent requests: looked up from the session Map and forwarded via `transport.handleRequest()` — the Map is trusted only while its recorded owner matches the presented bearer
- On an ownership mismatch: `mcp_sessions` is re-read. A row naming the presented bearer rebuilds the session (the token-rotation self-heal); anything else — including a store error, which fails closed — is `404 {"error": "invalid_session"}`
- On a request for a session this process doesn't know: rebuilt from `mcp_sessions` via a stateless transport with `sessionId` assigned (see Session Rehydration)
- Session cleanup via `onsessionclosed` callback (triggered by DELETE requests), which clears both the Map and the stored row

### Tool Registration

Tools are registered using a centralized approach:
- Each tool category has its own file in `src/tools/`
- `src/tools/index.ts` provides `registerAllTools()` to register all tools at once
- Tools receive the `mcpAccessToken` as a closure parameter for authentication
- Each tool includes a human-friendly `title` (e.g., `get_sleep` → "Sleep Data")
- Tools do **not** declare an `outputSchema` — Withings payloads carry dynamic, device-dependent fields, so response shapes are documented per tool here rather than described statically
- Each tool includes `annotations` (`readOnlyHint: true`, `destructiveHint: false`, `openWorldHint: true`) since all tools are read-only Withings API queries
- Tool handlers return their payload through `toolResponse()` (src/tools/index.ts) as a single JSON-stringified `content` text block — there is no `structuredContent` field

## Withings API Integration

**Authentication:**
- Auth URL: `https://account.withings.com/oauth2_user/authorize2`
- Token URL: `https://wbsapi.withings.net/v2/oauth2`
- Scopes: `user.metrics,user.activity,user.sleepevents,user.info`
- Token response format uses `action: "requesttoken"` and returns `status: 0` on success

**API Endpoints** (src/withings/api.ts):
- Base URL: `https://wbsapi.withings.net`
- Sleep: `/v2/sleep` with action `getsummary`
- Measures: `/measure` with action `getmeas`
- Workouts: `/v2/measure` with action `getworkouts`
- Activity: `/v2/measure` with action `getactivity`
- Intraday Activity: `/v2/measure` with action `getintradayactivity`
- User Devices: `/v2/user` with action `getdevice`
- User Goals: `/v2/user` with action `getgoals`
- Heart List: `/v2/heart` with action `list`
- Heart Signal: `/v2/heart` with action `get`
- Stetho List: `/v2/stetho` with action `list`
- Stetho Signal: `/v2/stetho` with action `get`

**API Client** (src/withings/api.ts):
- `makeWithingsRequest<T>()`: Generic authenticated request handler with typed responses (interfaces in src/types/withings.ts)
- Automatically maps MCP tokens to Withings tokens via token store
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Checks if Withings access token is expired or expiring within 5 minutes, and automatically refreshes it using the refresh token before making API calls
- Error handling for Withings API status codes (status !== 0)
- All requests use POST with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type

# Claude Code Operating Instructions

## Core Philosophy

Default to **parallel execution** and **web-verified information**. Sequential execution and offline assumptions are fallback modes, not defaults. When in doubt: parallelize, then search.

---

## 1. Parallelization Protocol

### Default Behavior: Parallel-First

**Before starting any multi-step task:**
1. Decompose the full task into atomic subtasks
2. Build a dependency graph — identify which subtasks have no prerequisite outputs
3. Dispatch ALL dependency-free subtasks simultaneously using parallel tool calls
4. Only after their completion, dispatch the next wave of now-unblocked subtasks
5. Repeat until task is complete

**Rule:** If two tasks do not share an input/output dependency, they MUST run in parallel. Sequential execution of independent tasks is a performance violation.

### Parallel Tool Call Patterns

Prefer batching tool calls in a single response turn rather than sequential turns:

```
# CORRECT — dispatch independent reads simultaneously
- Read file A
- Read file B
- Search web for library version
(all in one turn)

# WRONG — needless sequencing
- Read file A → wait → Read file B → wait → Search web
```

### Sub-Agent Parallelization (Task Tool)

When using the `Task` tool to spawn sub-agents:
- Spawn all independent sub-agents in a single dispatch batch
- Maximum **5 concurrent sub-agents** at any time to avoid context exhaustion
- Each sub-agent must have a clearly scoped, non-overlapping responsibility
- Define explicit output contracts for each agent before spawning
- After all agents complete, explicitly synthesize their outputs — do not present raw agent outputs as the final answer

### TodoWrite Protocol

When managing complex tasks with `TodoWrite`:
- Mark tasks as `in_progress` before starting a parallel batch
- Track each parallel thread separately
- Never mark a parent task `completed` until all parallel children resolve
- Flag dependency chains explicitly in todo descriptions

### When Sequential Execution Is Permitted

Sequential execution is only justified when:
- Task B requires Task A's output as direct input
- Tasks write to the same file or resource (race condition risk)
- A previous parallel batch returned an error that changes downstream logic
- User explicitly requests step-by-step confirmation

In all other cases: **parallelize**.

---

## 2. Web Search Mandate

### Search-First Triggers

**Always perform a web search before proceeding** when the task involves any of the following:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Library / framework versions | "What's the latest stable version of X?" |
| API behavior and signatures | Any external SDK, REST API, or CLI tool |
| Security advisories | CVEs, deprecated patterns, breaking changes |
| Best practices | Architecture patterns, language idioms updated post-2024 |
| Configuration options | Tool flags, environment variables, cloud service settings |
| Error messages | Unfamiliar stack traces, runtime errors |
| Compatibility questions | Node/Python/Rust version support, browser APIs |
| Pricing or limits | Cloud service quotas, rate limits, SLA details |

### Search Behavior Rules

1. **Search before assuming.** Do not rely on training knowledge for anything that changes over time. External information has a shelf life; always verify.

2. **Prefer official sources.** When web results conflict, prioritize: official docs > GitHub releases > well-known technical blogs > forums.

3. **Deduplicate within session.** If you have already searched for a query in this session and the result was unambiguous, do not re-search the same query. Cache the result mentally and reference it.

4. **Surface what you found.** When you use web search to inform a decision, briefly state the source and key fact. Do not silently use search results without attribution.

5. **Parallelize searches.** When multiple independent facts need to be looked up, dispatch all web searches simultaneously, not sequentially.

6. **Do not search for:** Internal project details, proprietary architecture, code that exists in the repository (read the file instead), or subjective style decisions.

### When Web Search Results Conflict with the Codebase

If web search returns guidance that contradicts patterns already established in the repo:
1. Note the conflict explicitly
2. Present both the current repo pattern and the web-sourced alternative
3. Do not silently override existing code with web-sourced patterns without user confirmation

---

## 3. Session Start Checklist

At the beginning of every new task or session, run the following in parallel:

- [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md` (this file) to confirm operating rules are loaded
- [ ] Identify the task's scope and decompose into subtasks
- [ ] Flag any subtasks that require web verification
- [ ] Check for existing relevant files in the repo before searching externally
- [ ] Dispatch first parallel batch

---

## 4. Quality and Safety Rules

- **No unverified version pinning.** Never write a dependency version (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.) without confirming via web search that it is current and non-deprecated.
- **No silent failures in parallel batches.** If one parallel subtask fails, halt dependent tasks immediately and report the failure before proceeding.
- **Conflict resolution in parallel file edits.** If two parallel sub-agents are asked to modify the same file, serialize those specific edits. All other work continues in parallel.
- **Do not hallucinate tool flags or API parameters.** If unsure whether a CLI flag exists, search first.

---

## 5. Communication Standards

- When executing a parallel batch, briefly state what is running in parallel and why
- When web search informs a decision, cite source and date if available
- When sequential execution is chosen over parallel, briefly state the dependency that forced it
- Keep explanations concise — action over narration
